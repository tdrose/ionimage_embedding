# Deep clustering of mass spectrometry imaging across datasets

Deep learning-based clustering approach to cluster ion images from mass spectrometry imaging data across datasets.
Optimized to work with datasets from the [METASPACE](https://metaspace2020.eu/) database.

## Installation

Before installation the package, 
install the fitting pytorch version for your setup (cpu/gpu) from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Next, Clone the GitHub repository or pull the latest updates.

In the terminal, navigate to the system directory:

'''
